<h1>Angular 2 Grid Demo</h1>
<p>This is a simple demo used for creation/testing of <a href="https://github.com/BTMorton/angular2-grid">angular2-grid</a>, a grid-based drag/drop/resize plugin directive for <a href="http://angular.io">Angular 2</a>. It makes use of angular directives so that in order to include it, all you need to do is add an "[ng-grid]" attribute to your container and an "[ng-grid-item]" to each of your grid items. It even works with the For directive to add boxes on the fly!</p>
<br />
<a (click)="addBox()">Add Box</a>
<br /><br />
<div [ng-grid]="{'margins': [5]}" (on-drag-start)="eventThrown($event)">
	<div *ng-for="#box of boxes; #i = index" [ng-grid-item]="{'dragHandle': '.handle'}">
		<div class="handle"></div>
		{{box}}
	</div>
</div>
